# NMSKeybinds
Searchable view of NMS key bindings

Rebinding NMS (PC) from WASD to ESDF was more complicated than it should have been, for me, so instead of playing another game, I did a nostalgic win forms exercise. This displays the NMS key bindings in a simple filterable view, for reviewing before editing. If it seems useful, I may add edit, backup and restore functions.
